# KR-KP-A7
This work aims to find the best classifier model for the King-Rook-King-Pawn-A7 dataset. Pycaret library was employed to search through multiple different high-performance machine learning models with different parameters. Through rigorous testing and analysis, a Light Gradient boosting machine had the best results with f1 score of 0.994. Along with the Light Gradient Boosting machine (LightGBM) testing, several other models were tested and trained to attempt to match the performance of the LightGBM.
